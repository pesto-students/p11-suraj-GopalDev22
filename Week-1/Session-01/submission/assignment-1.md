# Protocol Stack:

    In computer networking, a protocol stack refers to a set of communication
    protocols that are used to establish communication between devices or
    applications in a network. These protocols are arranged in a layered
    architecture, with each layer performing a specific function.

    The most widely used protocol stack in web development is the TCP/IP
      (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol stack. It
      consists of four layers: the application layer, transport layer, network
      layer, and data link layer. Each layer is responsible for a different
      aspect of communication, such as data formatting, data transmission,
      addressing, and error detection.

- Application Layer: The application layer is responsible for interacting with
  applications, such as web browsers or email clients.
- Transport Layer: The transport layer provides reliable data transmission and flow control between applications.
- Network Layer: The network layer handles the routing of data packets between
  different networks.
- Data Link: The data link layer defines the format of the data transmitted over
  the physical network.
