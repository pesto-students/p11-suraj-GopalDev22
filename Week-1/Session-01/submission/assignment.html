    <h1>Protocol Stack:</h1>
    <p>
      In computer networking, a protocol stack refers to a set of communication
      protocols that are used to establish communication between devices or
      applications in a network. These protocols are arranged in a layered
      architecture, with each layer performing a specific function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most widely used protocol stack in web development is the TCP/IP
      (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol stack. It
      consists of four layers: the application layer, transport layer, network
      layer, and data link layer. Each layer is responsible for a different
      aspect of communication, such as data formatting, data transmission,
      addressing, and error detection.
    </p>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="stack">
        <h3>Application Layer:</h3>
        <p>
          The application layer is responsible for interacting with
          applications, such as web browsers or email clients.
        </p>
        <h3>Transport Layer:</h3>
        <p>
          The transport layer provides reliable data transmission and flow
          control between applications.
        </p>
        <h3>Network Layer:</h3>
        <p>
          The network layer handles the routing of data packets between
          different networks.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Link:</h3>
        <p>
          The data link layer defines the format of the data transmitted over
          the physical network.
        </p>

      <b
        >Web developers typically use the application layer protocols of the
        TCP/IP stack to develop web applications</b
      >. These protocols include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File
      Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and others.
      These protocols provide the foundation for building web applications that
      can communicate with other devices or servers over the internet.

    <h1>Web Server:</h1>
    <p>
      Web servers are software applications that handle HTTP requests and serve
      web pages to clients over the internet. There are several types of web
      servers, each with its own set of features and performance
      characteristics.
    </p>
    <div class="content">
      <ul>
        <li>Apache HTTP Server</li>
        <li>Nginx</li>
        <li>Microsoft IIS</li>
        <li>Lighttpd</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="./Assets/webserver.jpg" alt="web server" />
    </div>
    <p>
      In terms of functionality and performance, the different web servers have
      their strengths and weaknesses. Apache is highly configurable and supports
      a wide range of features, but it can be resource-intensive. Nginx is known
      for its efficiency and ability to handle a large number of connections,
      but it has limited support for dynamic content. Microsoft IIS is tightly
      integrated with the Windows operating system, making it easy to deploy and
      manage, but it's limited to Windows platforms. Lighttpd is lightweight and
      efficient, but it's primarily designed for serving static content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, the choice of web server depends on the specific needs of the
      application or website, as well as the available resources and expertise
      of the development team.

    <h1>Web Hosting:</h1>
    <p>
      Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make
      their website accessible via the World Wide Web. When you create a
      website, you need a place to store all the files that make up your site.
      Web hosting services provide this storage space on servers, which are
      powerful computers that are connected to the internet 24/7.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several types of web hosting services available, each with its
      own set of advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common types of
      web hosting services are:
    </p>
    <div class="content">
      <ul class="web">
        <li>
          <b>Shared hosting:</b> This is the most affordable and popular type of
          web hosting, where multiple websites are hosted on the same server.
          All the websites share the server's resources, such as RAM, CPU, and
          disk space.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>VPS hosting:</b> Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting is a type of
          hosting where a physical server is divided into several virtual
          servers, each with its own set of resources. VPS hosting is more
          expensive than shared hosting but offers more control and flexibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Dedicated hosting:</b> With dedicated hosting, you get an entire
          physical server for your website. This type of hosting is ideal for
          large websites that receive a lot of traffic and require a lot of
          resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cloud hosting:</b> Cloud hosting is a type of hosting where your
          website is hosted on a network of interconnected servers. This
          provides better scalability and flexibility as your website can easily
          handle sudden spikes in traffic.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img src="./Assets/webhosting.jpg" alt="web hosting" />
    </div>
    <p>
      Each type of hosting has its own pros and cons, and the choice of hosting
      service will depend on your website's needs, budget, and goals.

    <h1>Scaling:</h1>
    <p>
      Scaling is the process of increasing or decreasing the capacity of a web
      application to handle more or less traffic or workload. In other words,
      scaling is the ability of a web application to accommodate more users or
      requests without affecting its performance or stability. It is important
      for web applications to scale because as the number of users or requests
      increases, the application can become slow, unresponsive, or even crash,
      resulting in a poor user experience or loss of business.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Scaling can be achieved through two main methods: vertical scaling and
      horizontal scaling.
    </h3>
    <div class="content">
      <ul class="scale">
        <li>
          <b>Vertical scaling</b> involves adding more resources to a single
          server, such as increasing the RAM, CPU, or storage capacity. This is
          also known as scaling up. Vertical scaling is suitable for
          applications that require more processing power and memory but don't
          necessarily need to be distributed across multiple servers. The
          disadvantage of vertical scaling is that there is a limit to how much
          a single server can be scaled, and it can become expensive to upgrade
          hardware.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Horizontal scaling</b> involves adding more servers to the existing
          infrastructure, creating a cluster of servers that work together to
          handle traffic. This is also known as scaling out. Horizontal scaling
          is suitable for applications that require high availability, fault
          tolerance, and load balancing. The advantage of horizontal scaling is
          that it allows the application to handle more traffic and workload as
          the number of servers increases. However, it requires additional
          infrastructure, such as load balancers and database replication, and
          it can be complex to manage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img src="./Assets/scale.png" alt="webserver scaling" />
    </div>
    <p>
      In summary, scaling is important for web applications because it ensures
      that they can handle more traffic or workload without affecting
      performance or stability. Vertical scaling involves adding more resources
      to a single server, while horizontal scaling involves adding more servers
      to the infrastructure. The choice of scaling method depends on the
      application's requirements, budget, and goals.
